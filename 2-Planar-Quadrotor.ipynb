    "### Building a 2D planar quadrotor model\n",
    "In this second notebook, we'll build a planar quadrotor model as discussed in the slides. Note that most of our base classes (e.g. `QuaternionState`, etc...) are built for a 3D quadrotor. This means that for this lecture, we'll effectively just ignore a dimension. In this case, we'll use `x` and `z` as our horizontal/vertical plane and assume the quadrotor is only able to rotate about the `y` axis that goes into the plane. In the `QuadrotorCommands` this means we'll use only the first 2 rotor rates and pretend the back two don't exist!\n",

    "#### Your work\n",
    "This is the first 'real' notebook and we've gone through material pretty fast. To get started, I've provided some ground-work for certain things. Throughout the code, you'll see `raise NotImplementedError()` exceptions in places where you're expected to write code (so replace them with your actual implementation). Please refer to the first notebook for more info on the program structure and coding guidelines. Given that we're doing a lot of math implementation here, the code is fairly dense, and I want you to err on the side of overclarification.\n",

From a control point of view, this drone is a little strange, it's relatively heavy and uses three-blade propellors, which means thrust is higher at lower rotors speeds."

I left a comment in the code where you're expected to use this, [refer to the documentation here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html). Note that for each timestep, we're defining a new ODE, so for each timestep, make sure to integrate from 0 to dt."
